# Fullstack community

The most important part about Fullstack ‚ö°Ô∏è is creating and building our community here. Every week at our meetups, we create a space and time to meet and pair together to keep this community growing üå± . We dedicate this space in this directory to give people a chance to introduce themselves and also celebrate how much our community has grown:

1. Create a [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) file (`.md`) with `my-github-name` as the filename.
2. Add your name on the first line as a header, using the `#` syntax, like `# My Name`. 
3. Add a short bio as a sentence.
4. Add an unordered bulleted list of links to any sites you'd like to highlight (i.e. Twitter, GitHub, blog, website) in this format: `Name of Site`, and the plain URL `http://my-site.com`, separated by a colon: `:`.
5. Add a comma-separated list of languages you're using or learning, like this: `Langauges: Lisp, Erlang`.
6. Now you're done! Create a Pull Request to submit your profile.

Here is an example:

```
# First Last

Introduce yourself in a sentence or two.

- Twitter: URL
- Website: URL
- GitHub: URL
- Languages: Comma, Separated, List
```
