# Fullstack community

> [Lives here](https://gr2m.github.io/github-community-list/) <3 The most important part about Fullstack ⚡️ is building and celebrating our community here 🌱. At our meetups, we create a space and time to meet and pair together to keep this community growing 🌲. We dedicate this space in this directory to give people a chance to introduce themselves and get to know each other:

1. Create a [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) file (`.md`) with `my-github-name` as the filename.
2. Add your **name** on the first line as a header, using the `#` syntax, like `# My Name`. 
3. Add a short **bio** as a sentence.
4. Add an unordered bulleted list of links to any sites you'd like to highlight (i.e. Twitter, GitHub, blog, website) in this format: `Name of Site`, and the plain URL `http://my-site.com`, separated by a colon: `:`.
5. Add a **comma-separated list** of languages you're into like this: `Langauges: Lisp, Erlang, Esperanto, Yiddish`.
6. Now you're done! Create a Pull Request to submit your profile.
7. Check yourself out here: https://gr2m.github.io/github-community-list/

Here is an example:

```
# First Last

Introduce yourself in a sentence or two.

```
