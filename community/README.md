# Fullstack community

The most important part about Fullstack ‚ö°Ô∏è is creating and building our community here. Every week at our meetups, we create a space and time to meet and pair together to keep this community growing üå± . We dedicate this space in this directory to give people a chance to introduce themselves and also celebrate how much our community has grown:

1. Create a text file including your name, a short bio, contact information, and languages you're using or learning (use format below). The name of the profile .md file should be your GitHub name (i.e. username.md).
2. Create a Pull Request to submit your profile.
