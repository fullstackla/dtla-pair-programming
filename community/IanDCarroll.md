# Ian Carroll

I have been learning the art of software development for about a year and have taken an outside-in agile-first approach. I'm also a certified ScrumMaster, love Pair Programming and am currently learning Test Driven Development (TDD), Extreme Programming (XP), Lean and Kanban. I experiment with Agile at work, home, and on my journey learning software. I have a diverse background in Retail, Theatre, Chinese Philosophy, Writing, Star Trek and Tea.
