# Good pull request examples:

Submitting your code improvements to an Open Source project requires good coding, but there's are more than machines reading your changes.

There are also humans who have to read the code. It's so much easier for an open source maintainer to read a helpful and friendly message about the pull request than try to reverse engineer your changes and what they ultimately mean for the project.

Bellow are some examples of awesome pull requests that lets the maintainer know the contributor has thought about them and their product instead of roughly pushing a code injection on them. It's also a major time saver for you and for them!

Definitely use these examples as role models for great pull request messages: It's good manners, it will make you more popular with maintainers and get your pull requests accepted faster!
