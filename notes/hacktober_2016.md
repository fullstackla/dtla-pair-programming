## Wait, but what is Hacktober? üéÉ
Consider Hacktober a chance to try something new that scares you, or continue on a legacy side project that also scares you. We'll work in pairs:

1. :candy: Trick or treating - meet your neighbors: **Stand Up, Halloween style** _What is one spooky, terrifying thing that has scared you recently and how are you or did you get over it?_
